BTCapsules is a Bitcoin time capsule for your
private keys. Open the program, type in a year
and your keys, and when the year arrives, your
private keys will be decrypted and available to
whoever you choose. 

BTCapsule now uses Bitcoin Core’s 'mediantime' 
to log the year from Bitcoin’s timestamp and 
decrypt your private keys. This actually solves 
two problems. Not only does BTCapsule use the only 
fully decentralized clock straight from the Bitcoin 
blockchain, but it also means BTCapsule never has 
to use the internet. This is not an API call to a 
centralized block explorer website. You can install 
Bitcoin Core, download the blockchain, and check the 
date offline.
